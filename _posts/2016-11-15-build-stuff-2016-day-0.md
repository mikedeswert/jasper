After a cancelled train ride, a chaotic taxi drive and a 2 hour flight, I finally made it to the Radisson BLU hotel in Vilnius, Lithuania.  
This will be the location of this year's [Build Stuff 2016](http://www.buildstuff.lt/), a software development conference that invites world-class speakers to talk about a variety of topics.  

Being able to attend this conference was actually the trigger for creating this blog. Over the years, my company ([Cegeka](https://www.cegeka.com/en)) has enabled me to go to several conferences; this time I wanted to give something back.
This post will be the start of a 3-day marathon, attending, interpreting and summarizing the events of Build Stuff 2016.

The conference started out with a small event that was free to attend. Two talks were given, one by Chris Condron ([@Condron](https://twitter.com/condron)) and another by Dan North ([@tastapod](https://twitter.com/tastapod)), followed by free beer.
Unfortunately I was only able to attend the last 15 minutes or so of Dan North's talk about "Event Storming for fun and profit", but I will try to recount them nevertheless.

### Event Storming for fun and profit

When facilitating an event storm session you will likely run into people that fall into one of the following categories:

- The **disruptor**
- The **know-it-all**  
    This person thinks he has the model all figured out, but when comparing his perspective to that of the other participants you will see that it's actually quite different. 
- The **wallflower**  
    This person is an introvert and just being around other people and engaging with them can drain their energy.
- The **"helper"**  
    This person thinks he's helping, but is not actually contributing to the exercise. It might be that he/she is just looking for a way to seem busy, instead of being engaged with the actual modelling exercise.
- The **actual helper**  
    This person is actually helping e.g. by subtly alerting you to people not fully engaging in the exercise.
- The **surprise star**  
    This person thought he/she could not bring anything to the table, but then apparently has a treasure of information.
    
Afterwards, some interesting questions were raised.

***Why events?***  
Events are measurable, they can be tested. They are more flexible than expressing yourself in activities. For example: *Dan is watering the plants* instead of *The plants have been watered*.
"Plants have been watered" as an event is more flexible than the activity of the events being watered.  
Describing activities immediately locks down **how** to do something instead of focusing on what needs to be done. As long as the "plants watered" event occurs, we're happy.

***How could I organize an event storming session with a remote team?***  
Strive for co-locality. If that is not possible, try to lean on technology to make everyone feel like they're in the same room.


So this rounds up day zero of the Build Stuff 2016 conference. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to enjoy my free beer!
