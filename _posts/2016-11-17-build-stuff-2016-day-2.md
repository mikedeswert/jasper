### Agile Application Security

> Michael Brunton-Spall

State of security, large companies lose large amounts of data to hackers more and more often

GameOver/Zeus Malware = banking malware
Sits on your pc and injects a pin input field when surfing to your banking website

Criminal economy => selling of infected PCs & support for malware

Advanced persistent threats
FIN4, Dark Hotel

What does security do?
PCI
Change control board
Securoty right now doesn't work. It's all theater.

Agile changes everything
want to release at least once a day

Explaining agile and underlining support, trust and simplicity

Principles
protect personal data
    know what data your keeping
    know who has access an how you keep it
    
Security design principles
    make a system that's hard to compromise
    minimize the impact of compromise -> segmentation
    make compromises easy to detect -> the faster you know something is wrong, the faster you can react
    
Risk management principles
    accept uncertainty
    security as part of the team -> not external
    understand the risks -> development teams are too often left in the dark about what the risks are
    security needs to trust decision making in the team
    security is part of everything
    user experience is important -> security needs to be just good enough (e.g. password policies, can actually make security worse)
    audit decisions (know who made decisions and when)
    
How does agile help
continual delivery of business value = continual acceptance of risk

a secure agile development
security must be an enabler of the team -> not gatekeepers ("yes, and" not "no", otherwise people will just work around them)
security should focus on providing the necessary tools for the team, so they can make the right security decisions (secure libraries, decision tracking, etc.)

safety engineering
    assuming 50% of users are idiots -> design system so it can handle failure
    
the unit of delivery is the team
the unit of decision makeing is the team
software bugs are not evenly distributed -> security team needs to be focused on the areas that matters
risk -> there is no such thing as zero risk, you need to accept that
    educate team to the threats and risks
    keep a running risk log -> add them to the stories
    apply risk decisions per story
    apply controls per story -> assign person in team for each story that will look at the story with a security hat on
    
heep track of your security debt

microservices
small systems focused en specific domain
business based
own their own data
strong contracts for communication
simple systems are more secure
security concerns aren't evenly distributed

BUT
moving to microservices is not like mpving from a complicated monolith to simple services
it's more like moving to a complex environment

use infrastructure as (!testable) code
    check open ports, certificates, etc.
    quickly and easily deal with patches
    
use cucumber BDD to check whether critical parts of the system still work after each deployment

What does Agile and DevOps do for security
automated testing gives me confidence that system is secure
infrastructure as code provides auditing for free
fast repeatable deploys
audit logs
code review of infrstructure changes

application whitelisting -> provided by infrastructure as code (e.g. puppet)
patching
minimise administrative controls (no manual ssh to the machine as root)

### How to be reliable even when things aren't working

> 

Uber

Heart of reliability, if there are no changes things should just keep working (Newton's 3rd law)
Managing reliability = managing changes

What changes are there:
software changes
network changes
compute changes
request pattern changes (increased load, different calls)
time/state (built-up internal state over time)

Measure availability (bad request / total request)
        latency (slow request / total request)
        quality (business specific)

Availability > latency, sometimes latency > quality

Rule 1. Always know when it's broken
Rule 2. Avoid global changes -> having multiple network providers, availability zones, datacenters, routers, etc. protexts you against fate or other people's mistakes
Rule 3. Moving traffic is faster than fixing -> C.A.P. Can A client Proceed
Rule 4. Make your mitigations normal -> test your back up plans regularly

alert fatigue -> track alerts

### Rise of the Machines - Automate your development

> Sven Peters
    
Atlassian

Automating your laptop setup -> Agent Charlie

Coding bots
Coding is not just coding -> Let's get rid of th eissue tracker
    - smart commits -> not really automation
    - in the works, createing branch and pull request automatically updates the issues
    - workflow helper that prevents branching from red build
    - pull request review automatically assigned to last commit or author of file + min amount of approvers
    - auto mergeing to master and intermediate version branches hotfix > version 1.0 > 1.1 > master
    
Test bots
    - Code quality decreases over time -> too focused on solving problems
        -> Dr. Code -> Hall of Shame & Hall of Fame?
    - For spotting design changes
        - Image compare bot
    - Hallelujah -> functional test dispatcher for running tests in parallel
    - Flaky test detector

Ops bots
    - faster feedboack loop when sending app to operations -> pagerduty
        -> you should own your code end to end
    - knowing which features really ship -> release notes bot 
        - hazelcast with github issues
        - zeroturnaround
        + no surprises
        + human readable issue descriptions
        + Think about custoemr value
        
Service bots
    - asking for and scanning log files -> hercules
        - scans log files and combines it with system knowledge
        - gets smarter over time
    -
    
Report bots
    - automating stand ups?
        - sometimes take too long -> stand up buddy, basically a timer
        - remind people it's stand up time -> chrome extension that opens a tab (play music)
        - setup VC calls -> same chrome extension but opens a VC call
        - timezones -> enter status update (hipchat plugin) sends team updates to other teams
    - chat bots
        - faster feedback
        - team knowledge
        - start discussion
        
   Do code reviews
   Write tests
   Have deployment scripts
        
   Building software is a craft (can be automated) <-> creating customer value is an art (hard to automate)

### reBuilding private cloud

>

Adform uses openstack and ceph to build their cloud implementation

terraform -> configuration management tool for virtual machines

### Make it faster!

>

Chrome dev tools
WebPageTest.org -> test performance from anywhere in the world

measure dns time, modern sites use multiple domains
response time
execution stages
    - html received, js  bootstrap, js loaded and initiated, site loaded
time to first byte (media files)
kb per second (for resources)

performance api
    - start, finish - track time between function calls
    - built on standard on w3C API (performance.mark & measure)
    
new relic insights
anodot

apache flume + spark

improving performance

RAIL model
response
animation
idle - defer processing to idle time (not during loading time)
load - delivering content

loading resources
-> use http/2 (in most cases)
-> don't over-bundle
    - removes opportunity to optionally load resources
    - "         "         to defer downloading of resources
    - every change is a cache buster
-> beware
     - download resources in parallel, not sequentially
     - too small files are bad for gzip
     
Be smart about caching
    - use a cdn -> monitor it
    - use proper cache settings in HTTP headers
    - service workers for commonly visited sites
    - link prefetching (with <link>, auto matically tries not toconflict with loading time and use idle time)
        rel="prefetch" cache beforehand -> when you stay within site
        rel="preconnect" similar but everything before before the actual fetch
        rel="prerender" takes the entire link and opens it in a virtual invisible tab (use when goign to different site)
        
Avoid blocking
    - async load scripts
    - async load css (bundle css with webpack)
    - async load resources (by default)
    
Define quantifiable performance goals (not "fast", but "under 100ms")
Continuouslu measure to achieve thos goals
Monitor to verify progress and prevent regression
Check in variety of scenarios (mobile, desktop, etc.)
    nothing beats real data
Remember: your customer have alternatives

### The Secret Sauce of Successful Software Teams

> Sven Peters

high performance teams
speak to each other
listen to each other
and respect each other

there is psychologicaal safety
#same mindset
 - build team knowledge -> bug fix rotation (bugs bunny)
                        -> feature buddy
                        
do the right things > doing things right

playbook with team best practices -> useful for guiding other teams (atlassian.com/team-playbook)

#supported by te rest of the organization
 - information -> company intranet
    - open
    - allow corrections
 - help from the rest of the organization
    -> empower teams to do things yourself

#they have compelling direction
    give teams more guidance (north star), a vision (2 year plan, 1-2 sentence statement)
        > themes > focus areas (max 4)
        -> measure (before you start working on the goal) VTFM
        
OKR to set goals for teams
e.g. Objective build mobile app
     Key result 1000 daily user
     score 700 daily user
 -> should be stretch goals
 -> querterly (gives stability)
 -> less is more (2-3 max)
Make them transparent
follow goals
implement sanity check
understand customer feedback

book: creativuty inc.

weekly email with nps scores

#structure in place
create cross-functional teams (ops, dev, design, tester)
information flows
you can make faster decisions
you have more diversity of thought

have rituals and refreshments
for example coference video fridays, "getting stuff done" days, innovation week

give kudos to each other!
office claping -> finished a feature during standup, start clapping
