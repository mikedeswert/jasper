### Netflix is actually a log generating app that just happens to stream movies

> Ali Kheyrollahi

Why microservices

calling people not the solution
decentralising decision centres => agility
frequent debekiolet => agility
reduced complexity of eack ms (divde/conquer) => agility
overall solution complex but

challenges
mindshift requiring new operating model -> might require restructure of IT department
difficult to build a complete mental picture of the solution
when things go wrong -> need to know where before why
potentially increased latency
but actual problem is the outliers, which are untraceable and difficult to solve

# activityId propagator

- correlation ids!

# retry and timeout policy

- retry mechanism
- preemptive timeouts
    -> short timeout, followed by longer timeout
    => problem can be cascading timeoutes
    
    static -> based on server slo
    dynamic -> > 95th percentile
    
# io monitor

- measure every time your code goes out of process
    -> recording methods -> calling record() (spf4j)
    -> ask library to record a closure
    -> aspect-oriented
    
    -> publishing result
        -> local file
        -> tcp and http
        -> udp
        -> raising kernel level event
        -> local communication (statsd)
        
- dapper (by google)
- zipkin (by twitter)

# circuit breaker

- tri-state

closed - traffic can flow normally
open - does not flow
half open - circuit braker tests the water again

netflix hysterix

- fallback
custom - serve content from local cache (206)
silent - return null/no-data/... (404)
fail fast - customer experience is important (5XX)

# health endpoints
- ping
- canary -> connectivity status and latency of service and its dependencies

-> both don't invoke application code


if you have more than 5 teams consider microservices
logging/monitoring/alerting is single most important asset
use activityid propagator to correlate
cloud is a jungle, without retry/timeout you won't survive
monitor and measure all calls to external services ("blame game")
protext your systems with circuit-breakers (and isolation)
canary helps you detect connectivity issues

### Worse is better, for better of for worse

> Kevlin Heney

patterns manifesto
we are uncovering better ways of developing software bu seeing how others have already done it

worse is better -> good enough software conept

hitting the market first is better -> myth
let somebody else make the mistakes

(worse) reduce featureset < (better) cleaner, smaller, rock solid

You have to finish things, that's what you learn from finishing things Neil Gaiman
In XP we learn by finishing things often

Maximizing the amount of work not done is not necessarily simplicity (actually two principles in one)

101 things I learned in architecture school - matthew frederick

We often pursue generailty -> the more specific a design idea is, the greater its appeal is likely to be
-> goign the opposite direction of simplicity, we've not finished things yet

within specifics you might find generality, but that's something diferent

# implementation characteristics are foremost
- implementation should be fast -> savings in time feel like simplicity
the laws of simplicity - john maeda

misunderstanding about evil preemptive optimization -> don't leave optimization to the end

no code is faster thatn no code

- it should be small (optimal size) -> we should regard writing lines of code as "lines spent" instead of "lines produced"

write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend (programmingisterrible.com blog post)


slideshare beyond projects - allan kelly
software development has "diseconomies" of scale, the more you have the harder it gets
software is cheapest in lots of small cartons (and reduce risk) (milk metaphor)

- it should interoperate with the programs and tools that the expected users are already using
failure of smalltalk to blame on it living in its own universe <> c++ integrated with what already existed
the unreasonable effectiveness of c - damien katz

- it should be bug-free

constraining things is not always a bad thing -> more likely to make you think

### Javaslang - Functional Java Done Right

> Grzegorz Piwowarek

former yoyo player and musician in a metal band

immutablility & referential transparency => building blocks for functional programming

lambda
functional interface goes to 8 parameters
checked functional interface that can throw exceptions

- composition
- lifting
    -> can wrap functions and change return typesF (Integer -> Option<Integer>)
- currying
    -> split up into smaller functions (Function2 -> 2x Function1)
- Memoization
    -> cache result

tuple
immutable, can be mapped

value
- option
- try
- lazy

functional data structures are immutable, persistent and have referential transparent methods
- Seq
    -> like reusable stream

Pattern Matching
advanced switch case

for those projects where switching language is not an option, javaslang brings some of that sala sugar to java 8

### Edge-Free Programming

> Michael Feathers
 
noticeable error handling is a symptom of bad design
 
what is an edge?
way of disrupting a program, discontinuity (goto, if/else, exceptions)

domain extension by using default behaviour
ok if everyone understands what the conventions are

contain edges in the protective shell around your application

how to form the shell?
when dealing with error handling we tend to speak about mechanisms instead of design

Null Object to deal with edges -> does swallow errors

when you return null from a function you pass the work to the caller

get things in a good state as fast as possible, so we don't need to warry about it further down the road
